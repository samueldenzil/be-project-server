# Welcome to Development Center
Here I will test new cool funtions before adding them to the core Floorplan To Blender library.

Requirements for running different python scripts will be added in requirements.txt in this folder.

It is my intention that all code in the development center is executeable before mergeing to master branch.

If you want more information about each development script check out the `./Docs` folder.
