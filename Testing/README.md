# Testing

Run all tests by running:

Run `pytest` in this folder to run all tests. Add --ignore=visuals to ignore gui required tests.

Use `pytest -h` for more information!

# TODO
Current tests are dummy unit-tests. 
These should be updated in future to check all input and output values.
Current tests will however do fine for first github workflows.
